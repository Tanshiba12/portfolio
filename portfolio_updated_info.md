/my story____________________________________
With an aim to do something independently besides my studies, I started my first work as an entrepreneur in 2023. Since I was a full-time degree student back then, I couldn’t do a full-time job. With a small savings from my pocket money, I established an online-based skincare company in my home country, which I operated from Malaysia. I used to export high-quality skincare products from Korea and sell them through online marketing. Since then, I have developed sales and marketing skills, which enabled me to further explore and work in multiple sales, social media marketing, and event-related jobs. Being an enthusiastic person, to align my creative design skills, I joined in multimedia team at a Research Center. There I was in charge of digital marketing, designing posters, and handling social media platforms. At the quarter-end of the year 2023, I worked as a student registration volunteer in the International Student Orientation Program (ISOP) at my university. It was a full-week tenure, paid volunteering job.  This experience taught me to manage critical situations and helped me develop my teamwork skills. A few days later, I got an opportunity to work in a protocol crew at a global event, Asia-Pacific Climate Week (APCW) 2023, organized by Persada Johor, held for the first time in Malaysia. In this event, I acted as a communicator, maintained event protocols, and facilitated smooth interactions with the delegates, VIPs, and four foreign Ministers. This event experience built my confidence in leading high-profile events with a strong focus on effective communication and team coordination. The year 2024 began with another new experience, when I did a part-time job as a customer service cashier in the JDT Football Stadium in Johor Bahru. In this job, I get to learn about managing financial transactions, handling seasonal subscription memberships, and resolving customer queries. 
As my journey has been all about learning, exploring, and trying new things, in November 2024, I joined BTA Globalx Sdn Bhd with an ambition to combine my technological knowledge and other versatile skills. Since the company focuses on multiple areas like education, collaboration, and events, I started taking responsibilities in design, content creation, communication, social media marketing, and handling different projects. In 2025, one of the biggest highlights of this journey was organizing the company’s global event, where I played the role of the event director. It was a full-day Anniversary and the BTA Globalx Excellence Awards event, where delegates from 30+ countries attended the event. I was responsible for leading the entire program from start to finish – managing the flow, coordinating the team, creative designing, marketing, and making sure everything ran smoothly—while also taking on the role of EMCEE, which pushed me to be more confident and present on stage. Separately from events, I was also responsible for creating their corporate websites. 
Meanwhile, I completed my internship in my Faculty’s Quality and Strategy unit under the supervision of my Academic Advisor. It was a major challenging experience as I worked on something new – developing an AI-powered Chatbot for FC’s Internal Quality Assurance (IQA). But as my Final Year Project was based on “Intent Classification of Homestay Booking in Malaysia using Machine Learning models,” it gave me a strong foundation in understanding how to collect and process data, train models, and evaluate their performance. This experience became extremely useful during my internship, where I applied the knowledge to build an AI-powered chatbot. I was able to design the system, embed intelligence, and optimize its responses effectively. The connection between my academic project and real-world application not only strengthened my technical skills but also boosted my confidence in developing practical AI solutions. This incredible learning experience allowed me to grow both professionally and personally. 
Every experience taught me something new, whether it was building confidence, improving my creativity, or learning how to work with people more effectively. Moving through these different domains helped me understand my strengths, push beyond my comfort zone, and grow into someone more adaptable, responsible, and ready for new challenges.
